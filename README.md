## 1. Project Snapshot

**Protein Design with ProGen2**  
An end-to-end workflow that fine-tunes the ProGen2 transformer on three Pfam families (PF00257, PF00069, PF00072) to generate novel, biologically plausible protein sequences. Covers:

- **Data acquisition & preprocessing**  
- **Model fine-tuning**  
- **Sequence generation**  
- **Comprehensive evaluation** (perplexity, sequence identity, HMMER recovery, attention analysis)
